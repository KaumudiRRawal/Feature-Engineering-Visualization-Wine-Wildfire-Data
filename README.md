# 🔬📊 Feature Engineering & Visualization: Wine & Wildfire Data  

This project explores **Wine Quality** and **Forest Fire** datasets using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **feature engineering**, and **data visualization techniques**. By applying statistical analysis, we uncover key insights into the **chemical composition of wine** and the **environmental factors influencing forest fires**.

## 📊 Project Overview  

### 🍷 **Wine Quality Dataset Analysis**
- **Objective:** Identify how physicochemical properties influence wine quality ratings.
- **Techniques Used:** Summary statistics, histograms, box plots, and pairwise correlation.
- **Key Insights:**
  - Alcohol and volatile acidity strongly impact wine ratings.
  - Different age groups tend to rate wine quality differently.

### 🔥 **Forest Fires Dataset Analysis**
- **Objective:** Examine meteorological conditions that impact wildfire spread.
- **Techniques Used:** Feature engineering, outlier detection, and distribution analysis.
- **Key Insights:**
  - Temperature and humidity are major contributors to fire intensity.
  - Outliers significantly affect statistical interpretation.
